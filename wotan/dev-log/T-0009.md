# T-0009: Explore building Docker image with all URM dependencies

**Status**: BLOCKED
**Phase**: PLANNING
**After**: T-0007
**Before**: —

## Context

Currently, each pod launch requires installing dependencies (flash-attn, adam-atan2, etc.) which takes time, especially for flash-attn compilation. Building a custom Docker image with all dependencies pre-installed would significantly speed up pod launches.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Document required dependencies and versions
- [ ] Create Dockerfile based on pytorch/pytorch:2.1.0-cuda12.1-cudnn8-devel
- [ ] Build and test image locally or on ICE
- [ ] Push to container registry accessible by ICE cluster
- [ ] Update ice/train.sh to use new image

## Verification Plan

### Tests to Create
| Test | Proves | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| `docker build` succeeds | Image builds | - |
| Import tests on container | All deps available | - |

### Regression Check
```
# On pod with new image
python -c "from models.urm.urm import URM; print('OK')"
```

### Manual Verification
- [ ] Pod launches faster with pre-built image
- [ ] Training runs correctly
