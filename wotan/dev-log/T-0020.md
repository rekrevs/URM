# T-0020: Implement automated training monitor with auto-kill on collapse

**Status**: READY
**Phase**: PLANNING

**Before**: —

## Context

Training runs on Sudoku are collapsing (loss→2.2, exact_accuracy=0%). We need an automated way to:
1. Monitor training in real-time
2. Detect collapse early
3. Kill failed runs
4. Restart with different hyperparameters

This enables rapid exploration of the hyperparameter space without manual babysitting.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Script monitors training loss/accuracy in real-time
- [ ] Detects collapse (loss plateau at ~2.2, accuracy stuck at 0%)
- [ ] Automatically kills training when collapse detected
- [ ] Supports hyperparameter sweep (tries next config after kill)
- [ ] Logs results of each attempt

## Verification Plan

### Tests to Create
| Test | Proves | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| Manual: Run monitor on live training | Monitor detects metrics | - |
| Manual: Observe auto-kill on collapse | Kill logic works | - |

### Regression Check
```
# N/A - new script
```

### Manual Verification
- [ ] Monitor correctly parses training output
- [ ] Collapse detection triggers at appropriate threshold
- [ ] Training process is cleanly killed
- [ ] Next hyperparameter config is started
