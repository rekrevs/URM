# T-0011: Update train.sh to use custom URM image

**Status**: DONE
**Phase**: COMPLETE
**After**: T-0010
**Before**: T-0003, T-0004

## Context

After building the custom Docker image, update the ICE training script to use it instead of the base PyTorch image.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] train.sh uses registry.ice.ri.se/aic-misc/urm-training:latest
- [x] Pod startup command simplified (no pip installs needed)
- [ ] New pod launches successfully with the image

## Verification Plan

### Tests to Create
| Test | Proves | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| Launch test pod | Image works on ICE | - |

### Regression Check
```
./ice/train.sh test-image nvidia-gtx-2080ti 1
```

### Manual Verification
- [ ] Shell into pod and verify dependencies

## Approach

1. Update train.sh image reference
2. Remove pip install from startup command
3. Test pod launch

## Implementation Notes

### IMPLEMENTING
Updated train.sh to:
1. Use `registry.ice.ri.se/aic-misc/urm-training:latest` instead of base pytorch image
2. Removed pip install commands from startup script
3. Simplified startup message
4. Added imagePullSecrets: urm-registry-cred for private registry access

## Evidence

Updated image line in train.sh:
```yaml
image: registry.ice.ri.se/aic-misc/urm-training:latest
```

## Outcome

train.sh now uses the pre-built image with all dependencies. Pod startup is much faster since no pip installs are needed.
